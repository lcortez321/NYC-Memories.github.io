            <!--<h2><strong> Wall Street Plaza</strong></h2>-->



            <!--<p>Wall Street Plaza is a small plaza located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. The plaza has a small waterfall tours the back of the plaza, adjacent front Street, opposite Water Street.</p>

            <p>Is not an official 911 Memorial place, but it does hold a special meaning for some of us who witnessed, and lived through 911. It has a nice breeze and comfortable benches, for you to enjoy some downtime, while eating lunch and visiting New York City. There are plenty of places to shop around the area. Century 21 department store, is just a few blocks away from this Plaza, located at 1972 Broadway.</p>-->

            <p> My thought in making this webpage was to help people who might be too young to remember 911, or for people who might come to visit New York City, and have questions as to how to visit the various 911 sites around the City.</p>

            <p>I hope you will find my site useful to you, and I hope it can answer some of your questions.</p>

            <p>Wall Street Plaza is a small plaza located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. The plaza has a small waterfall tours the back of the plaza, adjacent front Street, opposite Water Street.</p>

            <p>Is not an official 911 Memorial place, but it does hold a special meaning for some of us who witnessed, and lived through 911. It has a nice breeze and comfortable benches, for you to enjoy some downtime, while eating lunch and visiting New York City. </p>

            <p>There are many of us in New York and around the country that have the unfortunate distinction of having lived through and witnessed the horrible events of 911. For people that might be too young to remember the nightmare of that fateful day, or for any visitor to our great city who wishes to visit any of the many 911 related Memorials or sites in the City, I have created a simple site, that explains some of the Memorials, and other sites around the city, that commemorate and honor the heroes who died on 911.</p>

            <p> 911 occurred 16 years ago, to me, it seems like yesterday. The events of that day are ingrained in my memory as if it happened not too long ago. I will not bore you with the details of my life on that date, but know that my reason for creating this site was in helping people understand a little better, the reason behind many of the 911 Memorials and sites here in New York.</p>








            <!--<h3><strong>Staten Island 911 Memorial</strong></h3>-->


            <!--<p>What is special/meaningful about it? This memorial is dedicated to the 275 victims of the September 11th terrorist attack on New York City that lived on Staten Island</p>

            <p>Why should other people visit it? It has a beautiful view of lower Manhattan from across the waters here on the north shore of Staten Island. During the anniversary of September 11th, you have a unique view of the light towers projected to form the World Trade Center site.</p>

            <p> Best way to travel there?
            </p>-->

            <!--<h3>Directions:</h3>-->
            <!--<ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Take public transportation to the<strong> Staten Island Ferry</strong> (free ride for all commuters) and walk to the right following the water line.</p>
                    <h3> Freedom Tower</h3>
                    <p>The Freedom Tower is a great place to visit, whether you are a native New Yorker, or a visitor visiting from a faraway place. The 911 Museum is nearby, and it has plenty of the history behind the terrible events of that day. There are plenty of shops in the immediate surrounding area, or you can visit the many shops that are located inside the mall situated at the heart of the World Trade Center.</p>

                    <h3>Fiterman Hall</h3>
                    <p>Fiterman Hall is one of the many campuses at BMCC. It plays host to many students from around the world. And it provides an unbeatable world-class education. If you like to learn more about Fiterman Hall, you can visit the main page at <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/fitermanhall/facts.jsp">BMCC</a>, or you can read more about its history on this site.</p>
