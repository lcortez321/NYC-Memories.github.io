            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>The original Fiterman Hall was built in 1959, and donated to CUNY on behalf of BMCC in 1993 by Miles and Shirley Fiterman.</p>

            <p>Fiterman Hall was irreparably damaged when 7 World Trade Center fell against its south wall during the attacks of 9-11. Students were safely evacuated by BMCC faculty and staff.</p>

            <p>BMCC holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only institution of higher learning in the United States that sustained damage from a terrorist attack. In losing Fiterman Hall, BMCC lost one-third of its classroom and office space.</p>

            <p>For those of you who are interested, there is a history of Fiterman Hall that until recently, I myself, was not even aware of.</p>

            <p>Fiterman Hall was one of the sites that were destroyed when the attack on the World Trade Center took place, on September 11th, 2001. The building was donated to Cuny by Miles and Shirley Fiterman.</p>

            <p>As one of many New Yorkers who lived and witnessed 911, I was not aware until recently the history behind Fiterman Hall. For those of you who are too young to remember the history of 911, let me give you a brief history tour. </p>

            <p>Fiterman Hall lies just footsteps away from where the original World Trade Center stood, and where the new Freedom Tower stands. As a New Yorker who lived through the horrible events of 911, I can tell you that I will never forget that day.Fiterman Hall is one of the campuses of BMCC. Many students from all over the world come to study in New York, and many studies at BMCC, and their many campuses, including Fiterman Hall.</p>

            <p>As a current student at BMCC, I had the pleasure of studying at Fiterman Hall. It is a great place to learn, and visit. It is ideally located in the heart of Lower Manhattan and has many surrounding 911 sites, including the Freedom Tower and the official 911 Museum, located just a few minutes’ walk away from Fiterman Hall.</p>
