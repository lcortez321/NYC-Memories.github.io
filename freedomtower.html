            <p>For those of you who might be too young to remember, the Freedom Tower stands as a salute to the over 2,753 people who died at the World Trade Center during the attacks and the 2,977 overall 9/11 deaths that include the strike at the Pentagon and the airliner crash in Shanksville, Pa.</p>

            <p>The development of One World Trade Center started in 2004. But the Tower was not finished until November 2014. The Tower took many years to complete, due to various reasons, money, design of the building and a few other reasons. The developer was Larry Silverstein.</p>

            <p>For those of you who were either too young or not yet born, the Freedom Tower represents to many New Yorkers, what perhaps, the Vietnam Memorial represents to many veterans and their families. It is a symbol of enduring freedom and a testament to the ultimate sacrifice by those who perished on 911.</p>

            <p>You will also find a transportation hub that connects New York And New Jersey to each other, through the Port Authority's Path train, located right at the World Trade Center.</p>

            <p>The state-of-the-art World Trade Center Transportation Hub, completed in 2016, serves 250,000 Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) daily commuters and millions of annual visitors from around the world. At approximately 800,000 square feet, the Hub, designed by internationally acclaimed architect Santiago Calatrava, is the third largest transportation center in New York City.</p>

            <p>The World Trade Center Transportation Hub's concourse will ultimately connect visitors to 11 different subway lines; the <strong>PATH rail system;</strong> the <strong>Battery Park City Ferry Terminal;</strong> the <strong>National September 11 Memorial & Museum;</strong> <strong>World Trade Center Towers 1, 2, 3, and 4;</strong> and <strong>Brookfield Place (formerly known as the World Financial Center),</strong> which houses the Winter Garden. It represents the most integrated network of underground pedestrian connections in New York City.</p>

            <p>The <strong>&ldquo;Oculus&ldquo;</strong> serves as the centerpiece of the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, incorporating 78,000 square feet of multi-level state-of-the-art retail and dining. The concourses emanating from the Oculus link the entirety of the site above and below grade. With an additional 290,000 square feet of exciting, multi-level retail and dining space, the World Trade Center site is the focal point of Lower Manhattan. Source: Port Authority New York NJ

            <p>The Freedom Tower houses many businesses that are right at the heart of the financial district in New York.</p>
